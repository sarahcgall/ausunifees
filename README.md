# An analysis of the Australian Government's proposed university fee changes
On 19 July 2020, the Hon Dan Tehan MP ([\@DanTehanWannon](https://twitter.com/dantehanwannon)), Minister for Education , and Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash ([\@SenatorCash](https://twitter.com/senatorcash)), Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, announced the Job-ready Graduates Package (*[Tehan & Cash, Media Release, 19/06/20](https://ministers.dese.gov.au/tehan/job-ready-graduates-power-economic-recovery)*). This package aims to link the public investment in higher education with national priorities to ensure that more graduates are able to enter the workforce in sectors where employment opportunities are expected to grow and in regions where there are workforce shortages. 


Under this package, the Australian Government has proposed a series of measures, including:

1. The redistribution of student and Commonwealth contribution amounts to align with key growth areas, meaning that students studying areas such as science, health, mathematics, education, and nursing, will see reductions in the amount they pay for their degree;

2. A recalibration of degrees that are currently over- and under-funded to ensure that the total contribution (student & Commonwealth) equals the actual cost of teaching the degree; and

3. The provision of an additional 39,000 Commonwealth Supported Places by 2023.


#### How does the current system work?

In Australia, universities can offer prospective students a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) or a full-fee paying place. While full-fee paying places require the student to pay for the full cost of their degree, CSP students benefit from a government subsidy through the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. Under this scheme, the government contributes a portion of the total cost of the students' degree which the student does not have to pay back. This means, CSP students are only required to pay back their portion of the overall costs of their degree (*[Commonwealth supported places (CSPs), Study Assist, Australian Government](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/help-loans/commonwealth-supported-places-csps)*). 


Eligible CSP students are able to obtain a government loan for their contribution of their degree through the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) which means the student does not incur any upfront costs for their degree. This loan does not attract interest but instead is indexed to the Consumer Price Index each financial year. HELP debts are only required to be repaid by students once they start earning over a certain threshold. In the 2020-21 financial year, graduates earning over the repayment threshold of \$46,620 were required to pay back their HELP debt at a rate of between 1-10% of their income, depending on how much they earned (\$45,881-\$52,973 = 1%; \$75,145-\$79,652 = 5%; and \$134,573 and above = 10%) (*[Loan repayment, Study Assist, Australian Government](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/paying-back-your-loan/loan-repayment#:~:text=You%20pay%20back%20your%20HELP,21%20income%20year%20is%20%2446%2C620.)*). 


Each year under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, the Australian Government allocates the number of CSPs for each course and university and determines the commonwealth and maximum student contribution amounts of each unit of study. Each unit of study is allocated to a 'funding cluster' according to the field of study (*[Commonwealth Grant Scheme, Department of Education](https://www.education.gov.au/commonwealth-grant-scheme-cgs)*).

#### How is the system changing?
Under the proposed redesign of the funding arrangements, the funding has been consolidated into four clusters. 

***Proposed 2021 funding clusters and amounts:***

| **Funding cluster**  |**Part of funding cluster**  | **Maximum student contribution amounts** | **Australian Government contribution**  | **Total resourcing** |
| :----------- | :----------- | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |

An analysis of current funding found that some degrees were being over-funded and others under-funded compared to the actual costs of teaching the degree. **The proposed funding arrangements therefore recalibrates the overall funding of each degree to better align with actual costs of teaching the degree.** This means that study areas which were being over-funded have had a reduction in the overall costs, while study areas which were being under-funded have been increased (*[Job-ready Graduates Package discussion paper, Department of Education, Skills and Employment](https://www.dese.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/job-ready_graduates_discussion_paper.pdf)*).
 

The following plot shows the redistribution of funding from 2020 to the proposed funding in 2021 for each part funding cluster. It demonstrates a reduction in overall funding for study areas which were being over-funded, including: agriculture (*-\$2,841*); allied health (*-\$1,635*); behavioural science and social studies (*-\$1,905*); clinical psychology (*-\$2,792*); communications (*-\$4,392*); education (*-\$744*); environmental studies (*-\$9,341*); mathematics and statistics (*-\$3,148*); nursing (*-\$1,342*); and science, engineering and surveying (*-\$4,247*). It also demonstrates the increase in overall funding for study areas which were being under-funded, including: computing, built environments and other health (*+\$852*); creative arts (*+\$1,208*); English (*+\$4,400*); humanities (*+\$2,800*); languages (*+\$208*); and law, accounting, administraion, economics and commerce (*+\$2,247*). Dentistry, medicine and vetinary science (*+\$3,131*) increased in line with indexed rates.

An analysis of the overall cost of teaching each course, the emerging  employment priority areas, and the public and private benefits expected to be gained from students studying one course compared to another informed the proposed adjustments to the Commonwealth and maximum student contribution amounts for 2021. **By reducing the maximum student contribution amount for courses that align with key growth areas, the government hopes to incentivise prospective students to make more job-relevant education decisions** which leads to:

- higher employment outcomes in priority areas;
- higher course completion rates;
- higher proportions of professionals and managers; and 
- higher full-time incomes for graduates.

The following plot shows the Commonwealth and maximum student contribution amounts for each part funding cluster between 2009 and the projected 2021 proposal. It demonstrates a reduction in course costs for students studying agriculture (*-\$5,827*), allied health (*-\$1,827*), clinical psychology (*-\$2,984*), computing, built environment and other health (*-\$1,827*), education (*-\$2,984*), english (*-\$2,984*), environmental studies (*-\$1,827*), languages (*-\$2,984*), mathematics and statistics (*-\$5,827*), nursing (*-\$2,984*), science, engineering and surveying (*-\$1,827*). It also demonstrates an increase in course costs for students studying behavioural science and political science (*+\$7,816*), communications (*+\$7,816*), creative arts (*+\$1,016*), humanities (*+\$7,816*), and law, accounting, administration, economics and commerce (*+\$3,345*).

#### What changes have occurred previously?
Over the past decade, although students have not had a decrease in the amount that they contribute to their course costs, they have benefitted from few changes with indexed rate increases. 

![FundingChangePlot](https://github.com/sarahcgall/ausunifees/blob/master/figs/FundingChangePlot.png)

This however, is with the exception of four increases above the indexed rates in 2010 and 2013 under the then-Labor Government. These increases affected students studying nursing (*+\$1,148 (+28%)*), eduction (*+\$1,148 (+28%)*), science, engineering and surveying (*+\$2,078 (+33%)*), and mathematics and statistics (*+\$3,843 (+85%)*). 

![ChangePlot](https://github.com/sarahcgall/ausunifees/blob/master/figs/ChangePlot.png)



#### Why did these changes occur?
In 2005, following the [Nelson review](https://www.voced.edu.au/content/ngv%3A13176) which identified the need for a reform to higher education, the Coalition Government increased the cost of student contributions by a maximum of 25%. Those studying education and nursing were exempt from this increase as they had been identified as national priorities (*[Our universities, backing Australia's future, Nelson, 2003](https://www.voced.edu.au/content/ngv%3A38781)*). At the time, the ALP resolved to reverse the 25% increase (*[National Platform and Constitution, ALP, 2004](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/partypol/1024534/upload_binary/1024534.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22library/partypol/1024534%22)*).


During the 2007 election campaign, Kevin Rudd MP, then-Labor Opposition Leader, promised to reduce the costs of STEM subjects as an incentive to increase enrolments, stating:

> *The student contribution rate paid by maths and science students puts them at a distinct financial disadvantage when compared with those studying education, nursing, behavioural sciences, foreign languages, visual and performing arts, and the humanities...Some students considering taking up the study of maths or science at university are influenced by the level of debt they will accrue upon graduation compared to their counterparts undertaking studies in other disciplines.*

(*[New Directions for Maths and Science, Kevin Rudd MP & Stephen Smith MP, 2007](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/partypol/4X2M6/upload_binary/4x2m63.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22library/partypol/4X2M6%22)*).

This election commitment was honoured and subsequently implemented on 1 January 2009, reducing the student contribution for those studying maths and sciences from \$7,260 to \$4,077 (*[Higher Education Support Amendment (2008 Budget Measures) Act 2008](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2008A00043)*).


The following plots show the immediate affect that reducing the student contribution from science and mathematics had on enrolment numbers. The broad natural and physical sciences discipline, in which sciences and mathematics fall within, increased the number of commencing student (first year students) enrolments by 13.2% in 2009 and 14.3% in 2010. The number of not commencing student (second and third year students) enrolments increased by 5.5% in 2010 and 8.6% in 2011. The number of award course completions (graduating students) also increased by 5.9% in 2010 and 5.4% in 2011.

![EnrolmentsPlot](https://github.com/sarahcgall/ausunifees/blob/master/figs/EnrolmentsPlot.png)

In the annual higher education report on undergraduate applications, offers and acceptances in 2010, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations stated that the immediate growth in natural and physical sciences enrolments followed the decision by the Labor Party to incentivise students by reducing their student contribution.

> *The previous two years’ growth more than reversed the declines in demand for this field between 2004 and 2008...This increase in demand followed a suite of measures introduced in the 2008-09 Budget designed to encourage enrolments in mathematics and science and take-up in related occupations, including that the maximum student contribution for commencing students studying maths and science was lowered from $7412 to $4162 from 1 January 2009*

## Data collection, processing and cleaning
#### Scraping the data
Information about the allocation of units of study to funding clusters between 2009 and 2020 are held on the Department of Education website here: [https://www.education.gov.au/funding-clusters-and-indexed-rates](https://www.education.gov.au/funding-clusters-and-indexed-rates). Each PDF was retrieved using the `rvest`, `pdftools`, and `tabulizer` libraries and placed into individual csvs.

```
raw_data <- lapply(url, function(i){
  webpages <- extract_tables(i,
                             method = "stream",
                             output = "csv",
                             outdir = "~/ausunifees/data")
})

```

#### Cleaning the data
For ease, the data were formatted in Excel and combined into a single csv. This included:

1. Manually adding the projected 2021 funding clusters under both of the old and new funding arrangements published in the [Job-ready Graduates Package discussion paper](https://www.dese.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/job-ready_graduates_discussion_paper.pdf); 

2. Matching current 2020 funding clusters and part clusters to all other years for ease of analysis;

3. Adjusting the clinical psychology field of education code was to make it consistent throughout the years;

4. Matching the broad field of education with the narrow field of education (`Field of education code`) (*[Field of Education Types, Department of Education, Skills and Employment)](https://heimshelp.education.gov.au/resources/field-of-education-types#:~:text=The%20main%20purpose%20of%20this%20broad%20field%20of%20education%20is,0701)*);

5. Addition of data from the [Award course completions times series](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjIwYzhkMGYtMjgxNS00YTU1LWJhMDUtYzdlNjNmYmQ2MGZiIiwidCI6ImRkMGNmZDE1LTQ1NTgtNGIxMi04YmFkLWVhMjY5ODRmYzQxNyJ9) and student enrolments from the ([Enrolments time series](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMWExZWZmZDktODBiNS00NzA3LWJkOTgtN2ZkOTA3NzhiNThmIiwidCI6ImRkMGNmZDE1LTQ1NTgtNGIxMi04YmFkLWVhMjY5ODRmYzQxNyJ9) which were filtered by Bachelor degree, Table A providers (*see [Higher Education Support Act 2003](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2020C00078) for list*), and domestic students and matched to the broad field of education variable (*NB. these data contain full-fee paying students in addition to CSP students*);

6. Matching the study areas with the narrow field of education (`Study area`) (*[Study areas, QILT](https://www.qilt.edu.au/data/study-areas)*); and

7. Addition of data from  Graduate Outcomes Survey for each study area which were filtered by undergraduate students and matched to the study area variable (*NB. these data contain full-fee paying students, Table B and other providers, and overseas students*).


The csv was then uploaded, stored and cleaned in a single dataframe, `funding_data`, for analysis. This initial process included:

1. Removing the dollar signs and commas from the `Maximum student contribution amounts` and `Commonwealth contribution amounts` variables and converting the variables to numeric; and

2. Creating new variables - `Type`, `Total contribution` and `Funding ratio`.


***Variables included:*** funding year (`Year`); if the funding is under the old or new funding arrangements (`Type`); the original funding cluster number (`Original funding cluster`); the original funding cluster description (`Original funding cluster description`); the original part of funding cluster (`Original part of funding cluster`); the matched 2020 funding cluster number (`2020 funding cluster`); the matched 2020 funding cluster description (`2020 funding cluster description`); the matched broad field of education (`Broad field of eduction`); the number of commencing students enrolled by field of education (`Student enrolments: commencing students`); the number of not commencing students enrolled by field of education (`Student enrolments: not commencing students`); the number of award course completions by field of education (`Award course completions`); the matched broad study area (`Study area`); proportion of FTE one year after graduation (`FTE +1yr (%)`); proportion of overall employment one year after graduation (`Overall Empl. +1yr (%)`); median starting salary one year after graduation (`Median starting salary +1yr ($)`); the matched 2020 part funding cluster description (`Part funding cluster`); the unit of study description (`Unit description`); the field of education code (`Field of education code`); the maximum student contribution amounts (`Maximum student contribution amounts`); the Commonwealth contribution amounts (`Commonwealth contribution amounts`); the total contribution amount (Commonwealth + student) (`Total contribution`); and funding ratio (student/Commonwealth) (`Funding ratio`).
